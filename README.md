## Collection Photo Sharing App

This was the 2nd project I undertook as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course. I worked in a team of 3, and we were given a week to create a photo sharing app.

****

### The Brief

"You will need to create a photo sharing application.

Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners; and they will also be able to tag photos, and make tags searchable. Users will be able to view other users albums. They will be able to comment on the photos, and either up vote or down vote them. The homepage will display the most popular photos."

### My Role

* Planning - user journey and building wireframes in Balsamiq
* Validation
* Authentication (Devise)
* Authorization (Cancan)
* Image uploading (Carrierwave and Rmagick)
* User profiles and album views - building and styling
